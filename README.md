# HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
In the face of rapid global digital transformation, many hospitals still rely on manual or fragmented systems to manage critical operations such as patient records, appointments, prescriptions, and billing—leading to inefficiencies, errors, and data insecurity. This project, “Development of a Hospital Management System using Python and MySQL,” aims to provide an integrated, user-friendly software solution that streamlines these processes. Built with Python (Tkinter GUI) and MySQL (via PyMySQL), the system incorporates Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to protect sensitive data. It is designed to improve operational efficiency, enhance patient service quality, and offer a cost-effective solution for small to medium-sized hospitals in Vietnam.
